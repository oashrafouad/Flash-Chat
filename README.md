This app is part of [Angela Yu's iOS Development Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/), here's **what I learned:**
* Custom TableView for messages
* Using Cocoapods packages for implementing features like animated welcome screen 
* Firebase Authentication for registration and logging the user in
* Storing and retrieving messages data in Firebase Firestore
* The ViewController Lifecycle and App Lifecycle
  
I also improved upon the app by adding **features of my own**:
* Clear messages history button
* Playing sound when sending and receiving a message
